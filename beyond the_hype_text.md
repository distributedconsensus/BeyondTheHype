#### Marketplaces are..
Two sided market where buyers meet sellers, sellers meet buyers. 
For eg : “Alice wants to buy phone , she goes to amazon, where bob is selling phone via amazon.”
Delivery of information products/services  where you get paid or pay someone.
Exchange of value is only as successful as it is secure Customer confidence.


Problems
Electronic marketplaces have to cope with much higher amount of uncertainty regarding to the quality and reliability of the products they buy or the information they obtain from other players in the respective online business communities.[1]
But oftentimes what is lacking from these platforms are two key elements, namely transparency and social interactions. These twin pillars of commerce — whether online or in person — reflect the most important aspect of making a sale, and that is trust.[2]

Decentralised Marketplaces on blockchain
The blockchain gives us a chance to cut out those rent-seeking middlemen, with revolutionary new business models that allow fees to go to ~zero.
There’s no single point of failure. This lack of centralization gives us censorship resistance — not only from governments that like to ban certain types of marketplaces.
Decentralized marketplaces allow us to redistribute value to the people who actually contribute the most value in the network.
Global value of network 


Advantages
A network of nodes lists items offered through the marketplace by individual businesses, eliminating single-point- of-failure scenarios and preventing a single controller firm from manipulating the shared central database;
Anonymity
Immutable  “access” to information (such as listings) as desired by the seller, since each node is able to list prices, goods, and reviews pertaining to goods.


Lazooz 
The Lazooz distributed ride-sharing network is another example of a decentralized marketplace in which customers sharing rides use a mobile application to order the ride. On the Lazooz network, individual participants produce a “Zooz” token used to compensate drivers. Each transaction, or ride, is recorded on the blockchain’s network of nodes[1]

Openbazaar
OpenBazaar is a decentralized mar- ketplace in which software is installed on each seller’s node where listings are created. The marketplace accepts Bit- coin as its mode of payment and helps users trade with one another by reduc- ing transaction costs compared to a conventional marketplace.
