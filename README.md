# DIStributed CONsensus -- BeyondTheHype
## August 3rd & 4th 2018, Boulder, Colorado 
***

We've created this repository as an experimental way incentivise the community to participate in our event. The idea being that we use the gitcoin protocol to create bounties for talk/workshop/etc topics that we would like to see at the conference. 

You can view and create talk topics ("issues") [here.](https://github.com/distributedconsensus/BeyondTheHype/issues)

Ideally, the community will also be able to vote (via donations to a given issue or by other means) on what topics are of interest. 

If you see a topic you'd like to present on please reply the issue thread and we can go from there. All talk proposals will be routed though our Call For Papers process which will be announced soon. 

For now, as an experiement, we're open seeking feedback (and your patience) as we further refine the process!
